# 🚀 My Experience at Smart Material Technology

During my 6-month internship at **XYZ Tech**, I worked as a frontend developer on the internal dashboard project.

## 🔧 What I Worked On

- Rebuilt the dashboard using `React + Tailwind`
- Refactored old jQuery components into modern components
- Designed and built a dynamic form builder
- Implemented toast-based notifications for better UX

## 🧠 Challenges Faced

> “There was **zero design system** when I joined. I had to reverse-engineer UI from Figma screenshots sent on WhatsApp 😂.”

- Legacy CSS all over the place
- API endpoints were undocumented
- I had to build a reusable modal and form validation logic

## ✅ My Approach

- Created a reusable `useForm` hook
- Setup `prettier` and `eslint` for consistent code
- Proposed folder structure for better scalability
- Held weekly code reviews with the backend team

## 📈 What I Learned

- Real-life version of “team collaboration” (merge conflicts galore)
- How to design components for reusability
- Working under deadlines and version control

## 🖼️ Screenshots

## 🎯 Impact

> “We shipped the new dashboard ahead of schedule, and users reported 30% fewer bugs in the first month.”

### 💾 Save it as `experiences/xyz-tech.mdx`

Then in your Next.js app (assuming `contentlayer`, `next-mdx-remote`, or similar setup), you just:

- Fetch the MDX
- Display with your layout
- Style with Tailwind `prose` or your own vibe

### ✨ Bonus Tip:

You could even add a `type` field:

```md
type: "job" // or "internship" or "volunteer"
```
